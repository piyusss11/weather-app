Weather App

The frontend of the Weather App is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We utilized React Router for handling the navigation between different pages and React Redux for managing the application state efficiently.

To ensure a consistent and modern look and feel, we incorporated Material-UI, a React UI framework that adheres to Googleâ€™s Material Design guidelines. This allowed us to quickly build and style components with pre-defined design principles. Additionally, Axios is used to handle HTTP requests to fetch weather data from external APIs.


Backend and Authentication
Firebase Authentication is used for user authentication, allowing users to register and log in to the app.

State Management
Redux Toolkit is used to simplify the setup and usage of Redux, providing efficient ways to write Redux logic.
It helps manage the state of the application, ensuring that data is consistent and components are re-rendered when the state changes.

Deployment
Firebase Hosting is used to deploy and serve the web app.
